With the application, it is possible to create and publish advertisements and posters, schedule movie sessions, track user numbers, and sell tickets online. The system features three distinct interfaces: one for regular users, who can view featured movies and filter them by category or genre; one for cinema management; and one for cinema-owning companies and administrative purposes
